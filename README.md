# Particle Systems and Special Effects

## Introduction


## Object Pool
An object pool is a component that occupies a certain memory constantly to avoid constantly creating elements.

## Particle System
A particle system job is to emit particles, giving them their properties and managing them.

A particle can be an image with simple editions, like size, color and rotation.





## Extra TO-DOs

### XML Inclusion
A possible extra inclusion could be making the blueprints in an XML file, loading them and having them separated from the code.


### Animated Particles
Another thing that could be added is making the alphas as a spritesheet and making the particles animated.

### Various Interpolation Funtions
Now, when the particles change over time, they do it in a linear manner (LERP). Another addition can be to make different interpolation with different functions.
